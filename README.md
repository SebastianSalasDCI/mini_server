# Mini_Server
Small application that shows the creation of a very basic React+Express+Node project

## To run it:
- Run `npm install` on the main folder
- Run either `npm start` or `nodemon server.js` 
- if you want to test changes in the react app, run `npm install` on the client folder. use `npm run build` to see these changes in the server.
